This project includes three JavaScript functions to manipulate arrays and modify strings based on corresponding numbers.

Files:
1. arrayManipulation.js - Contains the following functions:
   - processArray: Takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where even numbers are squared and odd numbers are tripled.
   - formatArrayStrings: Takes an array of strings and an array of numbers. Modifies each string based on its corresponding number, capitalizing the string if the number is even and converting it to lowercase if the number is odd.

2. userInfo.js - Contains the createUserProfiles function:
   - createUserProfiles: Takes an array of names and an array of modified names. Returns an array of objects, each containing the original name, modified name, and an auto-incremented id.

Usage:
- Import the necessary functions from arrayManipulation.js and userInfo.js into your JavaScript code.
- Call the functions with the required arguments to process arrays and create user profiles.
